/**
 * Read model for Account Ledger.
 * <p>
 * This is a denormalized view optimized for queries.
 * It's built from events by the AccountLedgerProjectionService.
 * <p>
 * This demonstrates read/write separation in event sourcing:
 * - Writes go through AccountLedgerService → AccountLedger aggregate → Events
 * - Reads use this read model for fast lookups (no event replay needed)
 * <p>
 * Benefits:
 * - Fast queries without replaying events
 * - Optimized for specific query patterns
 * - Can have multiple read models for different use cases
 * - Eventual consistency is acceptable for reads
