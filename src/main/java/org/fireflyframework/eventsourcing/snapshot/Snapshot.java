/**
 * Interface representing a snapshot of aggregate state.
 * <p>
 * Snapshots are used to optimize aggregate reconstruction by capturing
 * the state at a specific point in time, reducing the number of events
 * that need to be replayed from the event store.
 * <p>
 * Snapshots contain:
 * - The complete aggregate state at a specific version
 * - Metadata about when and why the snapshot was taken
 * - Version information for consistency checking
 * <p>
 * Implementations should be:
 * - Serializable (support JSON/binary serialization)
 * - Immutable (state should not change after creation)
 * - Self-contained (include all necessary state information)
 * <p>
 * <b>Recommended Approach:</b>
 * <p>
 * Instead of implementing this interface directly, extend {@link AbstractSnapshot}
 * which provides common functionality and reduces boilerplate:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @Getter
 * public class AccountLedgerSnapshot extends AbstractSnapshot {
 *     private final String accountNumber;
 *     private final BigDecimal balance;
 *     private final String currency;
 *
 *     public AccountLedgerSnapshot(UUID aggregateId, long version, Instant createdAt,
 *                                 String accountNumber, BigDecimal balance, String currency) {
 *         super(aggregateId, version, createdAt);
 *         this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
 *         this.balance = balance;
 *         this.currency = currency;
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public String getSnapshotType() {
 *         return "AccountLedger";
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
